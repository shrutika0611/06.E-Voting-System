## Overview
The **E-Voting System** is a simple web-based application that allows users to log in, vote for candidates, and view election results. It is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.


## Features

- Candidate list display
- Secure voting (users can vote only once)
- Real-time vote counting and result display
- 

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: No backend (purely client-side implementation)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enter a username and click **Login**.
4. Select a candidate and click **Vote**.
5. View election results.

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main interface of the e-voting system.
